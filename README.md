Stani's Python Editor
=======================

Stani's Python editor is a successful python editor written by Stani Michiels in the early 2000s in python
using wxPython and some other toolkits. Since 2008, Stani has not done any more work on the project. Therefore, I decided to clone his code and start
maintaining the IDE and bring it a little more up to date.
